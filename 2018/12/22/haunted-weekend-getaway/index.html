    <p>in october i went to singapore to meet and travel with jung for the first time. thankfully it’s not a disasterrr (even tho my virtual credit card couldnt be used so i need to borrow jung’s money first T_T)</p>
<p>jung brought me so many thingsss. she was the one who introduced me with kewwopi and suppinel!! she also gave me a safe flight charm based on her doodle with additional lil jupiter, super cute sticker sets, her reylo postcards (my shipping heart can’t take it), and her graphic novel for free sob too good.</p>
<p>honestly compare to these i gave her potato…<br><img src="/jupiter-rants/2018/12/22/haunted-weekend-getaway/gifts.jpg"></p>
<p>on the first day we went to a toy’s store at orchard road and talked about how the price of lego star wars was the same as our hotel fee. later at night, we watched shutter because jung had been persuading me for a month. really scared at first but i was suprised in the end i was rooting really hard for the ghost instead of the livings.<br><img src="/jupiter-rants/2018/12/22/haunted-weekend-getaway/day1.jpg"></p>
<p>the next day, we visited jurong birb park and i found out that penguin arent hugable because they smell fishy and looks slimy ;_;</p>
<p>we went to halloween horror night at universal studio after that. i thought i could still stand the haunted houses. However i was wrong,,, the first haunted house (which was the least scariest one) already made me cry. i cant imagine if jung wasn’t there to guide me out of the haunted houses… she’s my saviour from all of the fake ghosts,<br><img src="/jupiter-rants/2018/12/22/haunted-weekend-getaway/day2.jpg"><br>still i need to be proud of myself for finishing 4/5 houses. i told jung she could go to the pontianak alone if she wanted to because i didnt think i could stand it since it’s the scariest one but she refused.</p>
<p>anyway we didn’t take any photo so jung drew these polaroids of us in meomi cat cafe and stranger things haunted house. she also drew a picture of us in jurong birb park and short comics about our trip. it’s such a waste not to show it to anyone so i will leave it here for everyone to see:</p>

(jung keep saying peru because it’s visa free)<br><img src="/jupiter-rants/2018/12/22/haunted-weekend-getaway/travelagain.jpg"></p>
